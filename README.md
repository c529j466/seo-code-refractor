# <Seo-code-refactor>

## Description

For this project I refactored the html and css for a webpage. By refactoring the code for this page, my motivation was to improve the search engine optimation for it. by refactoring the code, the organization was improved, the readability was improved, and acessibility was added for better seo. This project taught me what to look for in code to improve its organization, adding accessibility, writing the code in a readable manner with comments to clarify each section, and how to effectively use css to alter html.

## Installation

My project is a webpage so all that was neccessary was to upload the code to a repository and then use the link from that repository to load the page.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

I recieved help on this project from my instructors, Henery Winget and Chris Sinlasath

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
